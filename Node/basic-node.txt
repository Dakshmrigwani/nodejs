Interview for node

the nodejs is made up of C , C++ , JS

when we type and we get the result in the console so how nodejs works between this

i have added stack photo see it

we call this as event loop

main boy is call stack -> that uit ike register the data

when you write console.log this code run in MAIN() function by default it runs on the background

the stack follow LIFO rule

and when code checks if there is not any function then main also empty

node api keep the task which is part of c & c++ like setTimeout()

the task of c & c++ task wait for stack to empty when the stack empty like it reaches to finishing up the stack empty and 0 sec timeout reaches to stack
